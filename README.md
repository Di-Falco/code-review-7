## Description

This project uses C# classes to take and store a user-input order at an imaginary French bakery. The entier program is limited to the Console.

Upon running, the user is prompted to select an item from the menu by entering the item's number. The next prompt is to enter the desired quantity of the selected item. Then the user is given the option to purchase more items or end their order by entering Y or N. The program displays each item the user ordered along with their quantities, and the total cost of all items in the order.
